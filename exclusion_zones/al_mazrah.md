This page is currently a work-in-progress.

Al Mazrah is the first and arguably main Exclusion Zone in DMZ. It is by far the largest location in the game, and while that aspect may not have worked in Warzone 2.0, it makes the location one of the most approachable for new players or those looking for a more casual experience.

Being the capital of a fictional country located in Western Asia, Al Mazrah features skyscrapers alongside vast deserts, hydroelectric plants overlooking stone fortresses, and many more varied points of interest (POIs).

The layout and POIs featured in Al Mazrah changed frequently over the lifecycle of DMZ and Warzone 2.0 in general. Since DMZ will no longer be receiving updates as of the release of MWIII, it is safe to assume that the current layout of Al Mazrah will remain the same for the forseeable future.

## Map Cameos

Since Al Mazrah was built to be the flagship map of Warzone 2.0, it contained many references to previous Call of Duty maps that I like to call "map cameos". Multiple maps from COD's history have been recreated inside of Al Mazrah, and multiple of these recreations have been featured in Modern Warfare II as 6v6 maps as well.

- In Taraq Village, a reimagining of the Call of Duty (yes, *the* OG Call of Duty) map Neuville can be found. It was included in MWII under the name "Taraq" as both a 6v6 map and a "Battle Map" for Ground War and Invasion.
- Also in Taraq Village, a reimagining of Rust from the original MW2 can be found. The Battle Map version of Taraq also features this POI as the map's "B" point in Ground War.
- In Ahkdar Village, a recreation of Showdown from COD4 can be found. This version of Showdown was also added to MWII in Season 4.
- On a ship docked in Hafid Port, a recreation of Shipment also from COD4 can be found. This formed the basis of the version of Shipment added to MWII in Season 1 and eventually brought to MWIII on launch.
- The Al Safwa Quarry is, you guessed it, a recreation of Quarry from MW2.
- The Al Malik Airport is a recreation and expansion of Terminal from MW2. It is also featured as a Battle Map named "Al Malik International" in MWII.
- In Al Mazrah City, one of the skyscrapers includes a recreation of Highrise from MW2.
- The Sattiq Cave Complex was pretty close to a recreation of Afghan from MW2... except for the plane. The plane was eventually added in Season 2, and the area was made into a Battle Map in Season 3.
- The Zaya Observatory includes a recreation of the map Dome from MW, which got made into a 6v6 map in Season 2 along with a Battle Map of the Zaya Observatory in general.
- Several of the warehouses in Al Mazrah are map cameos. East of Al Mazrah City are a series of warehouses that are laid out like the MW2 DLC map Storm.
- In Hafid Port, there are two warehouses that act as a recreation of the (dogshit) MW2 map Pipeline.
