# Exclusion Zones

Exclusion zones are the locations available to play on in DMZ. Most of them were also available in Warzone 2.0, but there are also some locations exclusive to DMZ.

Currently, Al Mazrah is the only non-exclusive location that as of June 24, 2024 can only be played in DMZ.

The Exclusion Zones are listed on this wiki in order of release.
