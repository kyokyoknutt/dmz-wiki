# Welcome to a wiki for a game that's on life support.

I searched around the web for a wiki for this game, as I figured it would already exist... but there isn't one. So I'm making one myself.

A lot of info and content is taken from the existing [Call of Duty Fandom Wiki](https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/DMZ), but I will also be expanding and re-organizing content a lot more in order to flesh out the wiki into something that could be actually useful.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or suggestions, please make an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kyokyoknutt/dmz-wiki). I will get to it... eventually?

{: .warning }

This wiki will not be bound to an "objective" and "professional" standard. The writing will be slightly opinionated while still attempting to be informative. If you have a problem with that, I suggest touching grass.
