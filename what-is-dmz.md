# Wait, what even *is* DMZ?

DMZ is an extraction shooter gamemode of Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 that can best be described as "baby's first Tarkov".

If you don't know what an extraction shooter is, imagine being a special operations soldier tasked with infiltrating enemy territory, acquiring a special resource like technology or weapons, and then escaping via helicopter when you've accomplished your task. That's basically the gameplay loop of most extraction shooters including DMZ: you drop into an open space with both NPC enemies *and* other hostile players that you will need to fight against, accomplish various tasks, and attempt to escape via "exfil" before you get killed and lose all of the stuff you brought in and acquired on site.

Unlike most other extraction shooters, DMZ was built to be accessible and casual enough for general audiences. It's Call of Duty. They can't make it too hardcore. Thus, a lot of common mechanics and design philosophies of extraction shooters have been toned down, streamlined, and simplified in order to make the experience easy to pick up and play without much prior experience. It also leverages the design and content already made in Warzone 2.0 in order to streamline development (for example, most of the locations you will play in are just repurposed Warzone Battle Royale and Resurgence maps).

## Warzone "2.0"?

When [Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_II_(2022_video_game)) came out, Activision and Infinity Ward wanted to reboot the Warzone experience. The original Warzone had been running on the same game's engine for three years, so if they wanted to continue Warzone into the future, they needed to build it on a new foundation. Thus, when Warzone was announced for MWII, they branded it as "Warzone 2.0" to signify its soft reboot.

[It did not go well.](https://kotaku.com/warzone-1-player-count-cheaters-hack-caldera-1850284532)

The Warzone "2.0" branding was dropped roughly 2/3rds of the way into MWII's lifecycle, and now the Warzone that you see in MWIII is just called "Warzone" (while many people call this version of Warzone "Warzone 3" to distinguish it from both Warzone 2.0 and the original Warzone aaaaaa).

However, Warzone 2.0 still lives on... in DMZ. In fact, DMZ is the only Warzone gamemode that is *not* running on the latest version of the game engine. Instead, DMZ has been banished to the Shadow Realm (the MWII executable) while every other part of the Call of Duty HQ runs on the Modern Warfare III executable. This does mean that a lot of the quality of life features Warzone 3 brought have not been backported to DMZ, but it *also* means that most of the design from Warzone 2.0 that was stripped out in Warzone 3 remains in DMZ, for better or for worse. In terms of "game preservation", DMZ is now the only way you can play Warzone 2.0 (and, in fact, *any* version of Warzone before MWIII since the original Warzone was recently shut down).

The rest of this wiki covers the mechanics and content present within DMZ, including those inherited from Warzone 2.0 (with an emphasis on their implementation *in* DMZ, however). Hopefully, you can use this wiki to help you on your future infiltrations, or use it as a resource to learn what DMZ is (or, probably in the near future, *was*).
